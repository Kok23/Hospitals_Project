    "|Given that our problem is a binary classification problem (predicting whether a patient will be readmitted within 30 days or not), we can use supervised machine-learning techniques. These techniques will allow us to train a model on historical data and then use this model to make predictions on new data.|\n"

We could use various machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting) and select the one that performs best based on a chosen metric (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, AUC-ROC). It’s also important to validate our model using cross-validation to ensure it generalizes well to new data.|"
